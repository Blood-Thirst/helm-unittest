## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security bugs are taken seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest/security/advisories/new) tab.
We will take the security with higher priority and will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
